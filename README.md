# Mobile-PriceRange-Classification - DEEP Learning Project
This project gives the idea for buying new smartphone whose specifications are must be mentioned before, then it predict the price price range of the phone:

 0 --> (low cost),
 
 1 --> (medium cost),
 
 2 --> (high cost) and 
 
 3 --> (very high cost).
 
 
 Specifications for the smartphones are:   Battery power(mAh),  Battery Charging time,  Clock speed,  Number of Cores,  
 
 Bluetooth, Wifi, Sim Slot, 3G,4G,5G
 
 Front Camera, Rear Camera, Internal and External Expandable Memory, Dimension of the phone
 
 
 Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) is used to build the model and then optimise and selct best parameters using Keras-Tuner which gives a good accuray of 92% for the ouput
